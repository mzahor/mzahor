I am a software developer from Lviv, Ukraine üá∫üá¶, with over a decade of commercial experience.
Generalist, polyglot, with strong expertise in full-stack web development.
I also have some DevOps experience, configuring CI/CD, AWS infrastructure (both manual and using CloudFormation) and managing dedicated Linux servers.

Main tech stack:
 - Languages: JavaScript/TypeScript, C/C++/C#, Python, Go, SQL
 - Frontend: React/Redux/MobX (worked with many other frameworks in the past)
 - Backend: Node.js, .NET, Python (Django, Flask), Go
 - Databases: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, ElasticSearch, Redis, DynamoDB, Neo4j
 - DevOps: Docker, Kubernetes, Linux, AWS, Jenkins, Github Actions, Gitlab
 - Other: ELK, Jaeger, Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry

I love learning new stuff, so in my free time I usually play with:
- new languages (Rust lately, but did some Ruby, Racket, and ML in the past)
- Graphics programming using C++ (OpenGL, UnrealEngine, raytracing)
- IoT (Arduino, ESP8082), MicroPython, C, C++
- 3D printing

I'm a big fan of opensource, here's some libraries I worked on:
- https://github.com/aspecto-io/genson-js
- https://github.com/aspecto-io/sns-sqs-big-payload
- https://github.com/LeanyLabs/formula-engine
- https://github.com/LeanyLabs/microservice-seed
- https://github.com/mzahor/svgstore-mini-webpack-plugin & https://github.com/mzahor/svgstore-mini-loader
- https://github.com/mzahor/gulp-inject-file

Together with two parners, I founded a software development company in the end of 2019, called [LeanyLabs](https://leanylabs.com/).

The company aims to eliminate struggles that startups face with software development.
We specialize solely in web applications, thus always stay on the edge of technologies and best practices required to provide exceptional services.
Our experts shine in rapid prototyping and MVP development to quickly validate the idea and launch application to the market.
For companies with established technology expertise, we offer team extension service which supercharges development with a dedicated team of rare professionals.
